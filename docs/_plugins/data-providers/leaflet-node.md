This is a very simple javascript plugin, that lets you easily show places like businesses on a map. Just paste a link such as https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3060887211, and it magically grabs the location, name, hours, and phone number, creating a clickable pin on the map. This ensures your map data always stays up to date when you (or others) edit or move places.
